### Description:
This repository contains a coding quiz in a multiple choice response format. The Web Dev Simplified video 'Build A Quiz App With JavaScript' was helpful in formulating the Java Script (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k). A timer function was sourced from this repository: https://gist.github.com/adhithyan15/4350689 . James Q Quick's video 'Build a Quiz App (4) - Display Feedback for Correct/Incorrect Answers' assisted with applying classes to correct vs wrong answers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LYxkClHnV0).
