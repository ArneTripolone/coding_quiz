# Coding Quiz

### Description:
This repository contains a coding quiz. Regretably I was unable to produce a high-score page in the given time. The Web Dev Simplified video 'Build A Quiz App With JavaScript' provided most of the Java Script. A simple timer function was sourced from this repository: https://gist.github.com/adhithyan15/4350689 . James Q Quick's video 'Build a Quiz App (4) - Display Feedback for Correct/Incorrect Answers' assisted me with applying classes to correct vs wrong answers.
